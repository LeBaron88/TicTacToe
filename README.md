# TicTacToe
a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in python using the turtle module

To run the game you need to download all the files on your local computer and run "Main.py".

How To Play

Use your mouse to point on the cell you would like to place your marker and complete a full line to beat the AI (is kinda stupid as playing using random position).

Unfortunately only one game is available per run. (would update it once I get my other projects completed, my apologies)
 
Note: the game main purpose was for me to apply the basic knowledge of python I got after a 2h crash course (still basic as written the same day).
